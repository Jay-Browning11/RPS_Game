# RPS_Game
A basic program I created in C# that allows the user to play Rock, Paper, Scissors with a CPU opponent

I have explained in the code how it all works for anyone interested

The user is asked to input their name which will be used throughout the various games, The user will then be asked to choose either Rock, Paper or Scissors. The CPU
Opponent chooses one of these options at random and once it's revealed what the CPU chose points are awarded to the winner, if the player and CPU inputs are the same
then it will be a draw and neither the player nor the CPU get a point. The first to 3 points wins overall at which point the overall winner is declared and the player
is asked if they would like to play again, choosing no closes the program and choosing yes restarts the program from just after the player name was set. If an input that
is not Rock, Paper or Scissors is chosen by the player then they will receive an error message and the program will ask again for an input, no points are awarded.
The "QUIT" command will close the game at any point.
